Throughout the tariff schedule the expression \"plastics\" means those materials of headings 3901 to 3914 which are or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerization or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticizer) by molding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence. Throughout the tariff schedule, any reference to \"plastics\" also includes vulcanized fiber. The expression, however, does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of section XI.\n2. This chapter does not cover:\n(a) Lubricating preparations of 2710 or 3403;\n(b) Waxes of heading 2712 or 3404;\n(c) Separate chemically defined organic compounds (chapter 29);\n(d) Heparin or its salts (heading 3001);\n(e) Solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any of the products specified in headings 3901 to 3913 in volatile organic solvents when the weight of the solvent exceeds 50 percent of the weight of the solution (heading 3208); stamping foils of heading 3212;\n(f) Organic surface-active agents or preparations of heading 3402;\n(g) Run gums or ester gums (heading 3806);\n(h) Prepared additives for mineral oils (including gasoline) or for other liquids used for the same purposes as mineral oil (heading 3811);\n(ij) Prepared hydraulic fluids based on polyglycols, silicones or other polymers of Chapter 39 (heading 3819);\n(k) Diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 3822);\n(l) Synthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of chapter 40, or articles thereof;\n(m) Saddlery or harness (heading 4201) or trunks, suitcases, handbags or other containers of heading 4202;\n(n) Plaits, wickerwork or other articles of chapter 46;\n(o) Wall coverings of heading 4814;\n(p) Goods of section XI (textiles and textile articles);\n(q) Articles of section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof);\n(r) Imitation jewelry of heading 7117;\n(s) Articles of section XVI (machines and mechanical or electrical appliances);\n(t) Parts of aircraft or vehicles of section XVII;\n(u) Articles of chapter 90 (for example, optical elements, spectacle frames, drawing instruments);\n(v) Articles of chapter 91 (for example, clock or watch cases);\n(w) Articles of chapter 92 (for example, musical instruments or parts thereof);\n(x) Articles of chapter 94 (for example, furniture, luminaires and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings);\n(y) Articles of chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports equipment); or\n(z) Articles of chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, mechanical pencils, and monopods, bipods, tripods and similar articles).\n3.

The expression \"copolymers\" covers all polymers in which no single monomer contributes 95 percent or more by weight to the total polymer content. For the purposes of this chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together. If no single comonomer predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\n5. Chemically modified polymers, that is, those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.\n6. In headings 3901 to 3914, the expression \"primary forms\" applies only to the following forms:\n(a) Liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\n(b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including molding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.\n7. Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 3901 to 3914).\n8. For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression \"tubes, pipes and hoses\" means hollow products, whether semimanufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last mentioned, those having an internal cross section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses, but as profile shapes.\n9. For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression \"wall or ceiling coverings of plastics\" applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, colored, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\n10. In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression \"plates, sheets, film, foil and strip\" applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).\n11. Heading 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of subchapter II:\n(a) Reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 liters;\n(b) Structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;\n(c) Gutters and fittings therefor;\n(d) Doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors;\n(e) Balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;\n(f) Shutters, blinds (including venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;\n(g) Large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\n(h) Ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and\n(ij) Fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch plates and other protective plates.\nSubheading Notes\n1. Within any one heading of this chapter, polymers (including copolymers) are to be classified according to the following provisions:\n(a) Where there is a subheading named \"Other\" in the same series:\n(1) The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix \"poly\" (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95 percent or more by weight of the total polymer content.\n(2) The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3901.40, 3903.20, 3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95 percent or more by weight of the total polymer content.\n(3) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named \"Other\", provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading.\n(4) Polymers not meeting (1), (2), or (3), above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared.\n(b) Where there is no subheading named \"Other\" in the same series:\n(1) Polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared.\n(2) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.

Throughout the tariff schedule, the expression \"parts of general use\" means:\n(a) Articles of heading 7307, 7312, 7315, 7317 or 7318 and similar articles of other base metal, other than articles specially designed for use exclusively in implants in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences (heading 9021);\n(b) Springs and leaves for springs, of base metal, other than clock or watch springs (heading 9114); and\n(c) Articles of heading 8301, 8302, 8308 or 8310 and frames and mirrors, of base metal, of heading 8306.\nIn chapters 73 to 76 and 78 to 82 (but not in heading 7315) references to parts of goods do not include references to parts of general use as defined above.\nSubject to the preceding paragraph and to note 1 to chapter 83, the articles of chapter 82 or 83 are excluded from chapters 72 to 76 and 78 to 81.\n3. Throughout the schedule, the expression \"base metals\" means: iron and steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten (wolfram), molybdenum, tantalum, magnesium, cobalt, bismuth, cadmium, titanium, zirconium, antimony, manganese, beryllium, chromium, germanium, vanadium, gallium, hafnium, indium, niobium (columbium), rhenium and thallium.\n4. Throughout the schedule, the term \"cermets\" means products containing a microscopic heterogeneous combination of a metallic component and a ceramic component. The term \"cermets\" includes sintered metal carbides (metal carbides sintered with a metal).\n5. Classification of alloys (other than ferroalloys and master alloys as defined in chapters 72 and 74):\n(a) An alloy of base metals is to be classified as an alloy of the metal which predominates by weight over each of the other metals.\n(b) An alloy composed of base metals of this section and of elements not falling within this section is to be treated as an alloy of base metals of this section if the total weight of such metals equals or exceeds the total weight of the other elements present.\n(c) In this section the term \"alloys\" includes sintered mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous intimate mixtures obtained by melting (other than cermets) and intermetallic compounds.\n6. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference in the tariff schedule to a base metal includes a reference to alloys which, by virtue of note 5 above, are to be classified as alloys of that metal.\n7. Classification of composite articles:\nExcept where the headings otherwise require, articles of base metal (including articles of mixed materials treated as articles of base metal under the General Rules of Interpretation) containing two or more base metals are to be treated as articles of the base metal predominating by weight over each of the other metals. For this purpose:\n(a) Iron and steel, or different kinds of iron or steel, are regarded as one and the same metal;\n(b) An alloy is regarded as being entirely composed of that metal as an alloy of which, by virtue of note 5, it is classified; and\n(c) A cermet of heading 8113 is regarded as a single base metal.\n8. In this section, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n(a) Waste and scrap\n(i) All metal waste and scrap;\n(ii) Metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons.\n(b) Powders\nProducts of which 90 percent or more by weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1 mm.\n9. For the purposes of chapters 74 to 76 and 78 to 81, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n(a) Bars and rods\nRolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including ‚Äúflattened circles‚Äù and ‚Äúmodified rectangles‚Äù, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including ‚Äúmodified rectangular‚Äù) cross section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\nWire bars and billets of chapter 74 with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 7403. This provision applies mutatis mutandis to the products of chapter 81.\n(b) Profiles\nRolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross section along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\n(c) Wire\nRolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including ‚Äúflattened circles‚Äù and ‚Äúmodified rectangles‚Äù, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel).

Subject to note 1 to this section, note 1 to chapter 84 and to note 1 to chapter 85, parts of machines (not being parts of the articles of heading 8484, 8544, 8545, 8546 or 8547) are to be classified according to the following rules:\n(a) Parts which are goods included in any of the headings of chapter 84 or 85 (other than headings 8409, 8431, 8448, 8466, 8473, 8487, 8503, 8522, 8529, 8538 and 8548) are in all cases to be classified in their respective headings;\n(b) Other parts, if suitable for use solely or principally with a particular kind of machine, or with a number of machines of the same heading (including a machine of heading 8479 or 8543) are to be classified with the machines of that kind or in heading 8409, 8431, 8448, 8466, 8473, 8503, 8522, 8529 or 8538 as appropriate. However, parts which are equally suitable for use principally with the goods of headings 8517 and 8525 to 8528 are to be classified in heading 8517, and parts which are suitable for use solely or principally with the goods of heading 8524 are to be classified in heading 8529;\n(c) All other parts are to be classified in heading 8409, 8431, 8448, 8466, 8473, 8503, 8522, 8529 or 8538 as appropriate or, failing that, in heading 8487 or 8548.\n3. Unless the context otherwise requires, composite machines consisting of two or more machines fitted together to form a whole and other machines designed for the purpose of performing two or more complementary or alternative functions are to be classified as if consisting only of that component or as being that machine which performs the principal function.\n4. Where a machine (including a combination of machines) consists of individual components (whether separate or interconnected by piping, by transmission devices, by electric cables or by other devices) intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the headings in chapter 84 or chapter 85, then the whole falls to be classified in the heading appropriate to that function.\n5. For the purposes of these notes, the expression \"machine\" means any machine, machinery, plant, equipment, apparatus or appliance cited in the headings of chapter 84 or 85.\n6. (A) Throughout the tariff schedule, \"electrical and electronic waste and scrap\" means electrical and electronic assemblies, printed circuit boards, and electrical or electronic articles that:\n(a) have been rendered unusable for their original purposes by breakage, cutting-up or other processes or are economically unsuitable for repair, refurbishment or renovation to render them fit for their original purposes; and\n(b) are packaged or shipped in a manner not intended to protect individual articles from damage during transportation, loading and unloading operations.\n(B) Mixed consignments of \"electrical and electronic waste and scrap\" and other waste and scrap are to be classified in heading 8549.\n(C) This section does not cover municipal waste, as defined in note 4 to chapter 38.\nAdditional U.S. Note\n1. For the purposes of this section, the term \"printed circuit assembly\" means goods consisting of one or more printed circuits of heading 8534 with one or more active elements assembled thereon, with or without passive elements. For the purposes of this note, \"active elements\" means diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices, whether or not photosensitive, of heading 8541, and integrated circuits of heading 8542.\nStatistical Note\n1. Provisions for semiconductor manufacturing and testing machines and apparatus cover products for the growth and processing of semiconductor materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide, the processing of such materials into semiconductor devices and the testing of such devices (in general the testing equipment, as well as some of the processing equipment, is classified in chapter 90). More specifically the goods include the following:\n(a) Wafer manufacturing equipment:\n(i) Crystal growers & pullers - used to produce extremely pure monocrystalline semiconductor boules from which wafers can be sliced. Most common methods employed in these crystal growers and pullers are the Czochralski and float zone methods.\n(ii) Wafer preparation equipment:\n(A) Crystal grinders - used to grind the crystal boule to precise diameter required for wafers and to grind the flats on the boule to indicate the conductivity type and resistivity of the crystal.\n(B) Wafer slicing saws - used to slice wafers from a boule of monocrystalline semiconductor material.\n(C) Wafer grinders, lappers and polishers - used to prepare the semiconductor wafer for the fabrication process. This involves bringing the wafer within dimensional tolerances. Especially critical is the flatness of its surface.\n(b) Mask fabrication and repair equipment:\n(i) Fabrication equipment - used to transfer design patterns to a mask or reticle, this equipment generally utilizes optical, electron beam or X-rays to write circuit patterns on photoresist coated substrates. After development, these substrates become the mask or reticle for wafer fabrication.\n(ii) Repair equipment - this equipment generally utilizes focused ion beams or laser beams. They are used directly on the mask or reticle to remove chrome.\n(c) Wafer fabrication equipment:\n(i) Film formation equipment - used to apply or produce various films on the surface of the wafer during the fabrication process. These films serve as conductors, insulators and semiconductors on the finished device. They may include oxides and nitrides of the substrate surface, metals, and epitaxial layers. The processes and equipments listed below are not necessarily limited to the generation of a particular type of film.\n(A) Oxidation furnaces - used to form a \"film\" of oxide on the wafer. The oxide is formed by the chemical reaction of the top molecular layers of the wafer with the applied oxygen or steam under heat.\n(B) Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by combining the appropriate gases in a reactant chamber at elevated temperatures. This constitutes a thermochemical vapor-phase reaction. Operations may take place at atmospheric or low pressure (LPCVD) and may use plasma enhancement (PECVD).\n(C) Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by vaporizing a solid.\n(1) Evaporation equipment - in which the film is generated by heating the source material.\n(2) Sputtering equipment - in which the film is generated by bombarding the source material (target) with ions.\n(D) Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) equipment - used to grow epitaxial layers on a heated monocrystalline substrate in an ultrahigh vacuum using beams of molecules. The process is similar to PVD.\n(ii) Doping equipment - which is used to introduce dopants into the wafer surface in order to modify the conductivity or other characteristics of a semiconductor layer:\n(A) Thermal diffusion equipment - in which the dopants are introduced into the surface of the wafer by the application of gases under high temperatures.\n(B) Ion Implantation - in which the dopants are \"driven\" into the crystal lattice structure of the surface of the wafer in the form of a beam of accelerated ions.\n(C) Annealing furnaces - which are used to repair the crystal lattice structures of the wafer damaged by ion implantation.\n(iii) Etching and stripping equipment - used for etching or cleaning surfaces of the wafers.\n(A) Wet etching equipment - in which chemical etching materials are applied by spraying or immersion. Spray etchers provide more uniform results than bath etchers, since they perform the operation on one wafer at a time.\n(B) Dry plasma etching - in which etching materials are presented as gases within a plasma energy field, providing an anisotropic etch profile.\n(C) Ion beam milling equipment - in which ionized gas atoms are accelerated toward the wafer surface. The impact results in the top layer being physically removed from the surface.\n(D) Strippers or ashers - using techniques similar to etching, this apparatus removes the spent photoresist from the surface of the wafer after it has served its purpose as a \"stencil\". This equipment is also used for removal of nitrides, oxides, and polysilicon, with an isotropic etch profile.\n(iv) Lithography equipment - used to transfer the circuit designs to the photoresist coated surface of the semiconductor wafer.\n(A) Equipment for coating wafers with photoresist - these include the photoresist spinners which are used to apply liquid photoresist evenly over the surface of the wafer.\n(B) Equipment for exposing the photoresist coated wafer with the circuit design (or a part thereof):\n(1) Using a mask or reticle and exposing the photoresist to light (generally ultraviolet) or, in some instances, X-rays:\n(a) Contact printers - where the mask or reticle is in contact with the wafer during exposure.\n(b) Proximity aligners - similar to contact aligners except actual contact does not take place between the mask or reticle and the wafer.\n(c) Scanning aligners - which use projection techniques to expose a continuously moving slit across the mask and wafer.\n(d) Step and repeat aligners - which use projection techniques to expose the wafer a portion at a time. Exposure can be by reduction from the mask to the wafer or 1:1. Enhancements include the use of an excimer laser.\n(2) Direct write on wafer equipment - these apparatus operate with no mask or reticle. They use a computer controlled \"writing beam\" (such as an electron beam (E-beam), ion beam or laser) to \"draw\" the circuit design directly on the photoresist coated wafer.\n(C) Equipment for developing exposed wafers - these include chemical baths similar to those used in photographic laboratory applications.\n(d) Assembly equipment:\n(i) Dicing equipment - these include sawing machines and scribing machines (including laser scribers) and dicing accessories such as wafer breaking equipment.\n(ii) Die bonding equipment - which installs the die to the package by soldering or gluing\n(iii) Wire bonding equipment - used for attaching thin wires or tapes (usually of gold, aluminum or copper) from the die bonding pads to the corresponding pads on the package.\n(iv) Packaging equipment - which are used to encapsulate or package a semiconductor device. They include sealing furnaces, lid welders, plastic encapsulation presses, lead trim and form equipment, package deflashers, and tin dip and solder plate equipment.\n(e) Testing and inspection equipment:\n(i) Optical inspection equipment - These include equipment that \"examines\" portions of the wafer surface and compares them either to a standard pattern or to other portions of the wafer surface.\n(ii) Electrical testing equipment - These include computer controlled systems that test the functions and electrical specifications of semiconductor devices through the application and detection of electrical signals or patterns.
